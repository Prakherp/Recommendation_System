# Recommendation System Chatbot Project


## Overview

The aim of this software project is to develop a chatbot that provides personalized recommendations for movies, books, and songs based on the user's preferences. The chatbot employs conversational Machine Learning (ML) technology to simulate natural language conversations with users, offering a user-friendly and interactive experience.

## Features

- **Movies Recommendations:**
  - Utilizes the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm to compute similarity and generate movie recommendations.
  
- **Books Recommendations:**
  - Vectorizes book descriptions, transforms vectors into matrices, and computes similarity for generating book recommendations.

- **Songs Recommendations:**
  - Uses Euclidean distance to compute similarity among song clusters, providing accurate song recommendations.

- **Messaging Platform Integration:**
  - Initially deployed on Telegram for convenient user interaction.

## How It Works

1. **User Input:**
   - The chatbot initiates a conversation by asking the user for their preference domain (movies, books, or songs).

2. **Domain Selection:**
   - Based on the user's choice, the chatbot proceeds to inquire about the specific movie, book, or song similar to which the user desires recommendations.

3. **Recommendation Generation:**
   - Utilizes distinct algorithms for each domain to compute similarity and generate tailored recommendations.

4. **Conversational Interface:**
   - Engages users in a natural language chat, making the recommendation process interactive and user-friendly.

## Technologies Used

- **Conversational Machine Learning (ML):**
  - Employs ML techniques to simulate chat conversations and understand user preferences.

- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm:**
  - Utilized for movies recommendations by computing similarity among movies.

- **Vectorization:**
  - Converts book descriptions into vectors for similarity computation in the books recommendations module.

- **Euclidean Distance:**
  - Applied for songs recommendations to measure similarity among song clusters.

- **Messaging Platform Deployment:**
  - Initially deployed on Telegram for easy accessibility.

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with additional messaging platforms.
- Expansion of recommendation modules for diverse content types.
- Implementation of user feedback mechanisms to improve recommendations.
